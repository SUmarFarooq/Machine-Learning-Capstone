# Machine-Learning-Capstone

## Background

This repository contains my capstone project for Udacity's Machine Learning Engineering Nanodegree. In it, I create a model to predict the likelihood of Kickstarter project success.

## Getting Started

The data for this projet is included in the folder labeled "data" within the "Project" folder, though it can also be downloaded from Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/kemical/kickstarter-projects).

This project uses Jupyter Notebooks and the following libraries:

* Pandas
* NumPy
* scikit-learn
* datetime
* pprint
* MatPlotLib
* Collections
* time

By navigating to the "final_project.ipynb" file in the "Project" folder, you can try running the same code or tweaking it to come up with a new model entirely. Enjoy!
